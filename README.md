# Tromino: Arduino-based Tetris-like Game

Tromino is an engaging, pocket-sized interpretation of the classic Tetris game, designed for the Arduino Uno with an LCD shield. This project explores the intersection of physical computing, game design, and user interaction in constrained environments.

## Project Overview

Tromino reimagines the iconic falling-block puzzle game within the limitations of a 16x2 LCD display, creating a unique and challenging gameplay experience. By leveraging the Arduino platform, this project demonstrates how to create engaging interactions with minimal hardware.

## Key Features

- Adaptive difficulty: Game speed increases gradually for a balanced challenge
- Custom block designs optimized for the 16x2 LCD display
- Intuitive controls using the LCD shield's button interface
- Score tracking and high score memory
- Optional background music for enhanced user engagement

## Interaction Design Highlights

- Simplified yet recognizable game elements to maintain cognitive ease
- Responsive controls for improved user agency and flow
- Progressive difficulty to balance challenge and skill, promoting a state of flow
- Audiovisual feedback to enhance the sense of direct manipulation

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD Shield with buttons
- (Optional) Piezo buzzer for audio feedback
